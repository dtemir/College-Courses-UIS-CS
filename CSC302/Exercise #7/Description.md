A binary search tree starts with a root node and then each vertex can only have only one right and/or left child.

1. Create a drawing of what the tree looks like with the words:  mathematics, computers, Spanish, geography and zoology. (Alphabetical order).

2. Write the pseudocode to search the tree above and add “anthropology”.
