There are two parts to this exercise.
The **first** is to write the pseudocode that would be the design for the given scenario.
The **second** part of the exercise is to revise the pseudocode to account for a specific number of grades.

Scenario ***Part 1***: Develop a class averaging program that will process an arbitrary number of grades each time the program is run.

Scenario ***Part 2***: How would your pseudocode change if you were told that there would be 25 grades entered instead of being an arbitrary number?
