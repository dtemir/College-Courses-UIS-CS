There are two parts to this exercise.
The **first** is to write the pseudocode that would be the design for the given scenario.
The **second** part of the exercise is to revise the pseudocode to account for a specific number of grades.

Scenario ***Part 1***: Develop a class averaging program that will process an arbitrary number of grades each time the program is run.  

Initialize count variable as zero
Initialize total variable as zero 
Initialize average variable as zero
Print “Enter grades one at a time, enter -1 to finish”
While input is not -1 do
  increment count variable
	add input to total
Set average to total divided by count
Print average

Scenario ***Part 2***: How would your pseudocode change if you were told that there would be 25 grades entered instead of being an arbitrary number?
     
Initialize total variable as zero 
Initialize average variable as zero
Initialize count variable as 25
Print “Enter grades one at a time”
For 25 times
  add input to total
Set average to total divided by counter
Print average
