Part 1:

A = {10, 12, 6, 8, 15}
B = {4, 12, 6, 9, 11}

a.  A ∩ B
b.  A U B
c.  A – B
d.  B – A

Give a short definition and then provide elements for sets A and B and show the results for each of these based upon your data.

Intersection: an operation in which only similar elements are extracted into a different set.
a. A ∩ B = {12, 6}
Union: an operation in which all unique elements are extracted into a different set.
b. A U B = {10, 12, 6, 8, 15, 4, 9, 11}
Difference is the set of all elements that are in the first set and not in the second set:
c. A – B = {10, 8, 15}
d. B – A = {4, 9, 11}

Part 2:

Write the pseudocode that will implement 1a and 1b. Note: sets cannot have duplicate elements

Initialize first set
Implement values from a file to this set
Initialize second set
Implement values from a file to this set
Declare the longest set as A
Declare the second set as B
Initialize a set C
Sort sets A and B
For the number of elements in the set A
	For the number of elements in the set B
		Compare elements of the set B with the element of the set A
		If there is a common element, implement this element into the set C

Initialize first set
Implement values from a file to this set
Initialize second set
Implement values from a file to this set
Declare the longest set as A
Declare the second set as B
Initialize a set C
Sort sets A and B
For the number of elements in the set A
	For the number of elements in the set B
		Compare elements of the set B with the element of the set A
		If none match, implement the element of the set A into the set C
Add all elements from the set B to the set C
