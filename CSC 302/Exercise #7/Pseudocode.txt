2.Initialize a variable value of the input value (first would be the word “mathematics”)
  Initialize variables root, rootLeft, rootRight
  If root has no value (since it will be empty for the first time, “mathematics” becomes root)
    root is equal to value
    return for the next input
  End-if
    If root is after value in alphabetical order (e.g., “computers” is before “mathematics”)
    If rootLeft has no value (null) (since it will be empty for the first time, “computers”)
      rootLeft is equal to value
      return for the next input
    End-if
    Substitute root with rootLeft and run again (using the same value but different root)
  End-if
  If root is before value in alphabetical order (e.g., “Spanish” is after “mathematics”)
    If rootRight has no value (null) (since it will be empty for the first time, “Spanish”)
      rootRight is equal to value
      return for the next input
    End-if
    Substitute root with rootRight and run again (using the same value but different root)
  End-if
