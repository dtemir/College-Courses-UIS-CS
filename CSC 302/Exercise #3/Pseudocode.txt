Part 1:

The bubble sort algorithm is a type of sorting algorithm that is based on comparing two consecutive elements and adjusting their positions by swapping them if they are in the wrong order.

Part 2:

Initialize a variable of the length of the array: n
  For i = 0 to n - 1
    For j = 0 to n - i - 1
      If (a j element from the array > a j + 1 element from the array)
        Initialize a temporary variable:= the value of an element of j from the array
        j of the array:= an element of j + 1 from the array
        j + 1 of the array:= temporary variable
      End-if
    End-for
  End-for
