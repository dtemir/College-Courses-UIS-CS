The following projects are a part of my coursework towards B.Sc. in Computer Science at University of Illinois Springfield. 

**CSC 225** (Computer Programming Concepts I) is an introductory course to the CS program utilizing ***Java 8*** as a primary tool to learn the basics of programming. Emphasis on control structures, procedures, simple data types, and structured data types, including arrays, records, and files.

**CSC 275** (Computer Programming Concepts II) is an introductory course to the CS program utilizing ***Java 8*** as a primary tool to learn the basics of programming. Extensive top-down design principles to solve non-trivial problems. Emphasis on advanced array applications, dynamic storage, and classes. Programming assignments include implementation of lists, stacks, queues, and recursions.

**CSC 302** (Discrete Structures) is an introductory course to the CS program utilizing ***pseudocode*** as a primary tool to learn the topics from discrete structures that are relevant to computer science. Topics covered are not limited to number systems, sets, logic, functions and relations, combinations, permutations, probability and statistics.
